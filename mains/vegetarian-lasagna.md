- **15 oz** ricotta cheese
- **1** egg
- **1/2 cup** grated Parmesan cheese
- **2 cups** shredded mozzarella cheese
- **1 lb** fresh spinach, rinsed and chopped (or use frozen spinach, thawed and drained)

- **1** small onion, diced
- **2-3 cloves** garlic, minced
- **1 tablespoon** olive oil

## Instructions

1. **Preheat Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Prepare Vegetables:**
   - Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, sautéing until softened.
   - Add the bell pepper, zucchini, and spinach. Cook until the vegetables are
     just tender and the spinach has wilted. Season with salt, pepper, and
     dried oregano.
   - Remove from heat and set aside.

3. **Mix Cheeses:**
   - In a bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, egg, half of the grated Parmesan cheese, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Set aside.

4. **Assemble Lasagna:**
   - Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce over the bottom of the baking dish.
   - Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.
   - Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.
   - Add half of the sautéed vegetables over the ricotta layer.
   - Sprinkle a layer of mozzarella cheese.
   - Repeat the layers: sauce, noodles, ricotta mixture, vegetables, and mozzarella cheese.
   - Top with a final layer of noodles, the remaining sauce, and sprinkle the rest of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses.

5. **Bake:**
   - Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
   - Remove the foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.

6. **Serve:**
   - Let the lasagna cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing.
   - Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.
   - Serve warm and enjoy!
